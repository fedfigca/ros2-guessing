# ROS2 Guessing game

This is a demo app to play around with ROS2, it's a Guessing game where the server selects a random number and the client will try to guess it.

This project creates two nodes, one **dealer** and one **player**, both contained in the `guessing_game` package, that communicate with each other in two ways, a _Topic_ and an _Action_.

In the `guessing_interfaces` package the action _Guessing_ and the message type _Guess_ are defined

## Requirements
